## Adopt our cat of the month: Buffy!

![Buffy](/images/buffy.jpg)

She considers herself the queen in her own universe, and likes to make her own rules. But Buffy is a rascal with irresistible charm and a bungee cord that keeps her coming back for more affection. Her world is anchored on her human’s attention.

What you will never suffer is boredom with Buffy in your life. She will tickle your humor with her playful antics. She does not walk, she runs. She goes everywhere. In your lap, your bed, your dinner if she has a chance. So let’s say, she is a high-energy cat. She needs space and toys and activity to tap her energy.

She is actually pretty well behaved, though. She is not a talker. She has perfect litter box manners and is healthy as a horse — as the saying goes. She does not like other cats, and behaves aggressively toward them. So she should be an only cat. She also has an instinctive reflex to grab a moving hand when she is in play mode. So she needs to belong to cat-savvy adults who know how to discourage the habit, probably picked up in kittenhood with humans who were the spoilers.

If you are looking for a feline companion who will own you with all her heart, and give you a chance to prove how much you love your cat, then Buffy is the feline for you!

## About

Whiskers of Hope, Inc. is a non-profit no-kill adoption organization for cats and kittens. We are an all-volunteer 501(c)3 not-for-profit charitable corporation. We operate a no-kill "virtual shelter" with all our cats in the care of foster homes.

Whiskers of Hope needs your help and is always looking for volunteers that would like to foster homeless cats. Fostering can be a very rewarding experience! For more information contact our Adoption Coodinator at: 781.648.4095, or e-mail whiskers@whiskersofhope.org.

We rely on the support of caring individuals to feed and get medical care of our cats. All donations are greatly appreciated and are tax deductible. Donations can be sent to our PO Box.

## Adopt a Cat or Kitten

All cats and kittens for adoption have been examined by a veterinarian, spayed or neutered, vaccinated against rabies and distemper (FVRCP), dewormed, treated to prevent fleas and mites, and tested for feline leukemia and feline immunodeficiency virus (FeLK/FIV).

Our adoption fees depend on the age of the cat, and we also offer a discount if you adopt two cats at once:

* Kittens (up to 6 months) $150, 2 for $250
* Cats (6 months- 6 years) $125, 2 for $200
* Older cats (6+ years) $100

## The Adoption Process

Adopting a cat will enrich your life, but it's a lifelong commitment that deserves careful consideration. We require a completed adoption application to start the adoption process. Adoption applications can be submitted on paper in person, or online. We will require a couple of days to process your application and confirm your references.

When your application is approved you will meet with the Whiskers of Hope, Inc. adoption coordinator and visit with the cat or kitten a couple of times until you both feel comfortable together. In some cases a home visit may also be required.

Please note that kittens (under 9 months of age) are only adopted in pairs unless you already have a cat or dog at home for company.

## Feline Immunodeficiency Virus (FIV)- What is it?

* FIV causes decreased immune function and increased susceptibility to infections and diseases in cats
* Humans are NOT at risk for FIV infection
* Transmitted mainly through bite wounds, not through normal social activities such as grooming
* Non-FIV infected cats in the same household are at low risk for infection but it is recommended that FIV+ cats do not join household with FIV- cats or are kept separate
* FIV+ cats should be spayed/neutered and kept indoors to prevent infection to other cats
* There is no cure for FIV, but infected cats may live many years symptom-free
* Regular vet check-ups, a nutritionally balanced diet, and a close watch for symptoms of illness with prompt treatment help to increase the FIV+ catâ€™s quality and longevity of life
